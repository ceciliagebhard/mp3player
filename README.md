Mp3 Player App Nonstop version

Welcome to BubbleGum Music PLAYER Nonstop version

This player has been made taking John Elder's Udemy course to build an MP3 Player App using Python and Tkinter.

I have added to the code a few lines for the App to automatically play the next song of the playlist when the current one is over.
Inside the playtime function is the use of try/except to catch an error that is generated when there isn't a next song.
This can be found at line 86 inside the script of player.py file.

To Run the Player
1. Download the file
3. Generate a virtual environment inside the folder where the file is located
4. Activate the virtual environment
5. Install pygame 
6. Install mutagen
7. Write the following: python3.9 player.py
8. And RUN
9. Add one song or a group of songs to a Playlist.
10. Enjoy!
11. You can choose the colour of the background or you can be surprised with a random background colour.
